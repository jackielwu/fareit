##Inspiration
We found inspiration for this application from a common issue that young people face: deciding on a restaurant to eat at. Often times, groups of friends will take a very long time to find a restaurant, and this app serves to eliminate that process.

##What it does
The application takes the user's criteria, including price range, distance, rating, and others, and returns a random list of restaurants that fit the chosen criteria.

##How I built it
We programmed the app in Swift using Xcode, and we implemented the Yelp API in order to get the restaurant information.

##Challenges I ran into
We experienced difficulties with the Yelp API, and none of us had used Swift prior to the Hackathon.

##Accomplishments that I'm proud of
We managed to build a working iOS app, while integrating the use of an external API, in thirty-six hours.

##What I learned
Swift, API, HTML, Web Apps, Domains, Hosting

##What's next for FareIt
We plan to add additional features, including group voting to further cut down on the restaurant choices, as well as further polishing the application.
